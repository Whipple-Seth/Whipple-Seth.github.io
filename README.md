This interactive narrative on the War of the Roses, built in Twine, showcases my digital storytelling skills and historical research abilities by inviting users to explore the causes, events, and outcomes of this critical period in English history. Structured to allow users to delve into specific sections on key figures, significant battles, and central political dynamics, the project presents complex content in a digestible, user-driven format. To enhance engagement, I implemented a point-based progression system, which requires users to visit each passage to unlock a comprehensive summary and bibliography, promoting thorough exploration of the material. This Twine project not only demonstrates my proficiency with digital tools but also reflects my commitment to creating informative, interactive experiences that support clear learning objectives. These are skills that I am excited to bring to future opportunities that value innovative content design and user engagement.
